# Animal_magic_practice_management

My 1st full stack web application, using HTML, CSS, Python, Flask & Postges.

This is a web based veterinary practice management app. It is aimed at practice staff, i.e. reception and vets. 
The design focused on displaying lots of relevant information with as few clicks as possible, whilst keeping screens clean, uncluttered and easy to pick out the information required.
I was also inspired by a conversation about making black & white websites and a techno-crush on excalidraw!
